Taking into account our current business climate in regards to the advancement of financial technology, BizOps began to take note that many of our clients were searching for a better way to save qualifying loans. Because of that, our team developed a new strategy to translate and save qualying loan data from our users, to a new CSV file. Within this program, we take user loan data and save it to a new CSV file.
